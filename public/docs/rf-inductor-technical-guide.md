## Introduction

This document explains the theory, calculations, and practical applications of air-core coaxial cable RF chokes. These devices are essential components in amateur radio and RF systems for controlling common mode currents and preventing unwanted radiation.

## What is an RF Choke?

An RF choke is an inductor designed to present high impedance to alternating current while allowing DC or low-frequency signals to pass with minimal loss. In the context of coaxial transmission lines, a **"coax choke"** or **"balun choke"** is wound from the coaxial cable itself.

### Basic Function
- **Blocks RF current** on the outside of the coax shield
- **Allows differential signals** to pass through the center conductor and shield
- **Prevents antenna currents** from flowing on the outside of the feedline

## Why Chokes are Important

### Common Mode Current Problem

When RF energy flows on the **outside** of a coaxial cable shield (common mode), it causes several problems:

1. **Radiation from the Feedline**
   - The coax itself becomes part of the antenna
   - Unpredictable radiation patterns
   - Reduced antenna efficiency

2. **RF in the Shack**
   - RF energy carried into the station
   - Equipment interference and malfunction
   - Safety concerns from RF exposure

3. **Ground Loop Issues**
   - Multiple ground paths create loops
   - Noise pickup and interference
   - Unstable SWR readings

### How Chokes Solve These Problems

A properly designed choke:
- **Presents high impedance** to common mode currents
- **Forces RF energy** to remain in the intended antenna system
- **Isolates the antenna** from the transmission line
- **Prevents RF feedback** into the station equipment

## Air-Wound Coaxial Chokes

### Construction

Air-wound coax chokes are constructed by:
1. **Coiling the coaxial cable** around a cylindrical former (PVC pipe, etc.)
2. **Maintaining consistent spacing** between turns
3. **Using the cable's outer conductor** as the inductor winding
4. **Creating an RF impedance** in series with the shield

### Advantages of Air-Core Design

**High Q Factor:**
- No lossy magnetic core materials
- Minimal power dissipation
- Excellent performance at VHF/UHF

**Broadband Operation:**
- Works across multiple amateur bands
- Predictable frequency response
- No core saturation issues

**Power Handling:**
- Limited only by coax cable ratings
- No magnetic core heating
- Suitable for high-power applications

**Cost Effective:**
- Uses existing coaxial cable
- Simple construction
- No expensive core materials

### Physical Parameters

**Former Diameter (Øf):**
- The diameter of the cylindrical form around which the coax is wound
- Determines the coil diameter and inductance

**Conductor Mean Diameter (Øm):**
- The effective diameter at which the outer conductor sits
- Calculated as: `Øm = Øf + insulation_thickness + conductor_diameter/2`
- Used in all inductance calculations

**Pitch Ratio (c/a):**
- Ratio of center-to-center spacing to conductor diameter
- Must be ≥ 1.1 to prevent conductor contact
- Affects proximity losses and self-capacitance

## Self-Resonant Frequency Limitation

### What is SRF?

The **Self-Resonant Frequency (SRF)** is the frequency at which the inductor's reactance equals its parasitic capacitance reactance, causing:
- **Zero net reactance** (purely resistive impedance)
- **Maximum impedance magnitude** at resonance
- **Capacitive behavior** above SRF

### Why Chokes Don't Work Above SRF

**Below SRF (Inductive Region):**
- Impedance increases with frequency
- Effective choking action
- High impedance to common mode currents

**At SRF:**
- Maximum impedance (often very high)
- Purely resistive
- Still provides some choking

**Above SRF (Capacitive Region):**
- Impedance **decreases** with frequency
- **No longer acts as a choke**
- Low impedance path for common mode currents
- May actually **enhance** unwanted currents

### Mathematical Relationship

The SRF is determined by:
```
SRF = 1 / (2π√(L × C))
```

Where:
- **L** = Inductance (calculated using Nagaoka's method)
- **C** = Self-capacitance (calculated using Knight's 2016 method)

---

## Calculation Methods

### Inductance Calculation

**Nagaoka's Method** (most accurate for air-core solenoids):

```
L = (N² × μ₀ × π × r² × K) / length
```

Where:
- **N** = Number of turns
- **μ₀** = Permeability of free space (4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m)
- **r** = Coil radius (mean diameter / 2)
- **K** = Nagaoka coefficient (accounts for finite coil length)
- **length** = Physical length of the coil

**Nagaoka Coefficient:**
Based on Wheeler's 1982 equation as modified by Bob Weaver:
- Accounts for the length-to-diameter ratio
- Corrects for end effects in finite-length coils
- More accurate than simple long-solenoid formulas

### Self-Capacitance Calculation

**Knight's 2016 Method:**
Uses empirical formulas derived from extensive measurements:

**Turn-to-Turn Capacitance:**
```
C_ttw = 11.27 × ε_ext × f_factor × (1 + k_correction)
```

**Inter-turn Capacitance:**
```
C_iae = 17.71 × (ε_int + ε_ext) / ln(1 + π² × f_factor)
```

**Total Capacitance:**
```
C_total = (C_ttw + C_iae) × coil_diameter × 10⁻¹²
```

### Resistance Calculations

**DC Resistance:**
```
R_dc = ρ × length / area
```
Where ρ = 1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ω⋅m (copper resistivity)

**AC Resistance:**
Includes **skin effect** and **proximity effect**:

**Skin Effect Factor:**
```
δ = √(1 / (π × f × μ₀ × σ))
DC_to_AC = d² / (4 × (d × δ - δ²))
```

**Proximity Effect:**
Uses Medhurst's empirical data (1947) based on:
- Spacing ratio (c/a)
- Length-to-diameter ratio
- Lookup table with interpolation

**Total AC Resistance:**
```
R_ac = R_dc × DC_to_AC_factor × Proximity_factor
```

### Complex Impedance

The choke presents a complex impedance:

**Inductive Reactance:**
```
X_L = 2π × f × L
```

**Capacitive Reactance:**
```
X_C = -1 / (2π × f × C)
```

**Total Impedance:**
```
Z = (R_ac + jX_L) || (jX_C)
Z = (R_ac + jX_L) × jX_C / ((R_ac + jX_L) + jX_C)
```

## Performance Thresholds

### Choking Impedance Guidelines

**Poor Performance (< 1000Ω):**
- Insufficient common mode suppression
- Noticeable feedline radiation
- Potential RF-in-shack problems

**Usable Performance (1000-3000Ω):**
- Adequate for many applications
- Some common mode suppression
- May need additional measures for critical applications

**Excellent Performance (> 3000Ω):**
- Excellent common mode suppression
- Minimal feedline radiation
- Suitable for contest and DX applications

### Quality Factor (Q)

```
Q = |X_L| / R_ac
```

Higher Q indicates:
- Lower losses
- More efficient operation
- Better performance bandwidth

## Design Guidelines

### Optimal Design Process

1. **Select Operating Band**
   - Choose IARU region for correct band edges
   - Ensure SRF is well above operating frequency

2. **Choose Coax Type**
   - Consider power handling requirements
   - Balance between size and performance
   - Common choices: RG-58, RG-213, LMR-400

3. **Determine Former Diameter**
   - Larger diameter → higher inductance
   - Consider mechanical constraints
   - Typical range: 75-150mm for HF

4. **Optimize Turn Count**
   - More turns → higher inductance
   - Monitor SRF to stay above operating frequency
   - Target impedance > 3000Ω

5. **Set Pitch Ratio**
   - Start with c/a = 1.5
   - Increase for lower losses
   - Balance between size and performance

### Frequency-Specific Considerations

**HF Bands (1.8-30 MHz):**
- Larger inductance required
- More turns or larger diameter
- SRF typically not a concern

**VHF Bands (50-148 MHz):**
- Moderate inductance
- SRF becomes important
- Fewer turns required

**UHF Bands (430+ MHz):**
- Low inductance required
- SRF is critical limitation
- Very few turns, careful design needed

### Multi-Band Operation

For multi-band chokes:
- Design for the **lowest frequency** of operation
- Verify performance on all desired bands
- Check that SRF is above the **highest frequency**
- Accept that impedance will be higher on higher bands
